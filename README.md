Web experimental art :

## MVP 

It produce non predictable result.
The most important for the MVP is not to get the best algorithm but have an algorithm that work. 
We cannot jump this part. We need to see results that doesn't work to improve the algorithm. 
Here's a list of functionnality that the algorithm have in the MVP

### Generation tools :
- ✅ randomNumber()
- ✅ trueOrFalse()

### Color generation : 
- ✅ Five types of pallet 
- ✅ Background

### Font generation :
- ✅ Fon family (array of font)
- ✅ Lineheight
- ✅ Font size
- ✅ Random ratio 

### Layout generation : 
- ✅ Margin (body)
- ✅ Margin (elements)

## To do 
- ✅ Move to VueJS
- Animation on content generation

## Beta 

Beta include a improved version of the algorithm. 

- keyword system ( one keyword by category)
- readability font check

(?) : Not sure about that

### Generation : 
- Seed 
- Randomness cursor

### Font generation :
- Google Fonts
- Number of fonts
- Color font (readability check)

### Layout generation : 
- Grid generation
- Accorded spacing (same scale on every spacing)
